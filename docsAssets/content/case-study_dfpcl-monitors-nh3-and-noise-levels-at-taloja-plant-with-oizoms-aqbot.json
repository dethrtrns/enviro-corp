(DFPCL) is one of India’s leading producers of industrial chemicals and fertilizers. With a strong presence across sectors like agriculture, mining, and pharmaceuticals, DFPCL is committed to sustainable manufacturing, employee safety, and environmental stewardship.\nAs part of its ongoing compliance and workplace safety initiatives, DFPCL partnered with Technovalue Solutions Pvt. Ltd. and Oizom to install real-time ambient monitoring systems at its Taloja plant in Raigad, Maharashtra. In January 2025, they installed two AQBot NH₃ monitors and two AQBot Noise monitors, enhancing the plant’s ability to track and control emissions and sound levels in line with regulatory standards.\nChallenges: Monitoring Critical Parameters in a Complex Manufacturing Setup\nOperating in the fertilizer industry involves dealing with sensitive gases and high-capacity machinery. For DFPCL, keeping ammonia emissions and noise levels within permissible limits was essential not just for compliance but also for ensuring a safe and productive work environment.\nManaging High Noise: The machinery used in fertilizer manufacturing must operate under 70 dB, as per industrial guidelines. Continuous noise measurement was necessary to ensure long-term compliance.\nControlling (NH₃) Emissions: As a by-product of several chemical processes, ammonia levels need to be monitored closely to avoid exposure risks and meet environmental regulations.\nSensor Accuracy and Calibration: DFPCL required high-range, well-calibrated sensors capable of performing reliably in an industrial environment with fluctuating emission levels.\nRemote and Continuous Monitoring: The environmental team needed online access to real-time data with the ability to track threshold breaches instantly.\nFast Response Time for Safety Events: A reliable alert system was crucial for taking quick action in case of any deviation in noise or NH₃ levels.\nReliable Onsite Support: Given the industrial scale and safety standards, having access to fast technical support and system calibration was a critical requirement.\nThese challenges required a robust, integrated monitoring solution that could deliver real-time data, enable proactive responses, and support regulatory readiness at all times.\nSolution: Real-Time Monitoring for Better Environmental Control\nTo address these challenges, DFPCL implemented Oizom’s AQBot range of environmental monitoring devices, supported by Technovalue’s deployment expertise. The solution was customized to deliver accurate data, seamless reporting, and automated alerts for both NH₃ and noise.\nTargeted Deployment Monitors: Two AQBot NH₃ and two AQBot Noise units were installed strategically across emission-critical and high-noise areas of the plant.\nHigh-Range Sensors: Each device came factory-calibrated with support for on-field recalibration, ensuring accurate readings even under variable conditions.\nInstant Data Access: All devices were connected to Oizom’s cloud platform, enabling DFPCL teams to view real-time data and trends remotely.\nConfigurable Alerts for Compliance Management: Custom thresholds for both ammonia and noise helped automate alerts, so the team could take action before limits were exceeded.\nIntegration with Internal Audit Systems: Data export features and log continuity made it easy to generate reports for compliance audits and internal reviews.\nThe installed system not only fulfilled DFPCL’s monitoring goals but also introduced a level of automation and data visibility that improved overall plant efficiency and regulatory confidence.\nTransformation: Turning Monitoring Data into Actionable Insights\nThe implementation of real-time noise and ammonia monitoring has significantly improved environmental oversight at DFPCL’s Taloja facility. The data generated by the devices has helped the team optimize operations and maintain a safe, compliant work environment.\nReal-Time Compliance: The system ensures that plant operations remain within defined noise and ammonia limits, thereby reducing exposure risks and enhancing regulatory adherence.\nEasy Access to Logs for Internal Audits: Plant managers can now pull historical reports directly from the platform, saving time and enhancing accuracy during audits.\nQuicker Responses: Instant alerts enable safety officers to act in real-time, preventing minor issues from escalating into larger hazards.\nStreamlined Operations: With automated reporting and threshold monitoring, the system has reduced manual tasks and improved process control.\nPerformance Analytics: Environmental trends help identify patterns and optimize equipment operation, leading to improved resource utilization and enhanced machinery maintenance.\nProactive Monitoring: The system introduces a new level of control and transparency, providing leadership teams with the confidence that environmental standards are being consistently upheld.\nBy turning environmental data into actionable insights, DFPCL has created a smarter, safer manufacturing setup that aligns with its long-term goals for compliance and sustainability.\nBroader Outcome: Building a Scalable Model for Industrial Monitoring\nBeyond solving immediate compliance needs, this deployment supports DFPCL’s broader objective of responsible and sustainable chemical manufacturing. The solution lays a strong foundation for replicable and scalable monitoring across other facilities.\nStronger Environmental Responsibility: The system enhances DFPCL’s commitment to worker safety and environmental protection, both of which are central to its ESG goals.\nConsistent Alignment with National Standards: Real-time monitoring keeps operations well within the noise and gas emission norms set by Indian environmental bodies.\nTransparent Reporting for Stakeholders: The solution enables clear communication of performance with regulators, partners, and internal stakeholders.\nReduced Risk of Non-Compliance Penalties: Continuous monitoring and automated alerts minimize the chance of breaching environmental regulations, reducing legal and financial exposure.\nThe project has set a precedent for effective, scalable monitoring in the fertilizer sector. With support from Oizom and Technovalue, DFPCL has demonstrated how data and technology can create long-term value in industrial operations.\nConclusion: Setting New Standards in Industrial Compliance Monitoring\nBy deploying Oizom’s AQBot NH₃ and Noise monitoring solutions, DFPCL’s Taloja facility has enhanced both its compliance posture and operational intelligence.
