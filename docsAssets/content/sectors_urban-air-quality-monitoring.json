Through data-driven planning, stakeholders can take necessary steps to reduce the pollution effect on aircraft and passengers.Read moreAirportsConstructionConstructionGlobal construction activities have increased drastically in the last few decades. Bulk material transportation, loading/unloading, and open-air storage are some activities contributing to air pollution. Concrete and mortar making, cutting and filling, and heavy equipment movement also have a fair share of air pollution. Air quality monitoring helps analyze long-term trends of dust concentration in the construction site and helps managers plan mitigative strategies.Dustroid real-time dust monitoring device can automate Dust suppressors at construction sites by air pollution monitoring data. The generated data thus helps in planning and executing the Environment Management Plan (EMP). Therefore, saving time and effort of the construction workers by effectively performing dust suppression with minimum human interventions.Read moreTunnels and Multi-level parkingAdverse weather situations reduce road visibility, and in particular weather conditions, the roads are slippery, which further increases the chances of accidents. Often tunnels and parking lots are the hotspots of heavy emissions. It is necessary to take preventive actions and avoid vehicular congestion in Tunnels and Parking lots. Outdoor Air pollution monitoring at crossroads, tunnels, and multi-level parking facilities is critically important for ensuring health and safety within the transportation networks.Oizom offers a range of outdoor air pollution monitor that helps authorities keep track of vehicular pollution in the urban city areas and highways. Threshold-based alerts can automate the ventilation systems and make them independent of human resources.Read moreTunnels and Multi-level parkingSea PortsSea PortsSeaports are busy and economically important infrastructure. Various seaport activities like loading, unloading and packing take place daily. These activities result in an increase in dust and other air pollutants concentration in the atmosphere.

Increased urbanization and auto mobilizing have made it essential to keep their outdoor activities in check during peak pollution hours. The idea is to empower the residents with data-driven suggestions for better healthcare and offer them a better environment.By installing outdoor air quality monitors and propagating the data to the public, we can trigger actionable data insights on the air pollution levels. With this, the residents can determine the best time to go for a walk, when to turn on air purifiers, and the best route to avoid traffic. Oizom offers comprehensive solutions for the environmental health and safety of the residents.Read moreAirportsGlobal air travel has increased tremendously in the last decade with more accessible domestic and intercontinental travel. With the rapid increase in Aviation, regulating air quality levels at airports and their vicinity is crucial. Many airports worldwide have installed real-time air quality monitoring infrastructure to accomplish this. The airport authorities remote access the air quality and weather data to gain actionable insights.Oizom air monitoring and integrated software offer real-time data and advanced data visualization and analytics. The data helps authorities accurately determine emissions and pollution levels at the airport.The software can further generate reports that help identify the impact of air pollution on the airport’s environmental health. Through data-driven planning, stakeholders can take necessary steps to reduce the pollution effect on aircraft and passengers.Read moreAirportsConstructionConstructionGlobal construction activities have increased drastically in the last few decades. Bulk material transportation, loading/unloading, and open-air storage are some activities contributing to air pollution. Concrete and mortar making, cutting and filling, and heavy equipment movement also have a fair share of air pollution. Air quality monitoring helps analyze long-term trends of dust concentration in the construction site and helps managers plan mitigative strategies.Dustroid real-time dust monitoring device can automate Dust suppressors at construction sites by air pollution monitoring data. The generated data thus helps in planning and executing the Environment Management Plan (EMP). Therefore, saving time and effort of the construction workers by effectively performing dust suppression with minimum human interventions.Read moreTunnels and Multi-level parkingAdverse weather situations reduce road visibility, and in particular weather conditions, the roads are slippery, which further increases the chances of accidents. Often tunnels and parking lots are the hotspots of heavy emissions. It is necessary to take preventive actions and avoid vehicular congestion in Tunnels and Parking lots. Outdoor Air pollution monitoring at crossroads, tunnels, and multi-level parking facilities is critically important for ensuring health and safety within the transportation networks.Oizom offers a range of outdoor air pollution monitor that helps authorities keep track of vehicular pollution in the urban city areas and highways.
