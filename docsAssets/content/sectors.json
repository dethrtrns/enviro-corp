An essential step to improving the situation is to monitor air quality. Hence, investing in a smart, accurate, robust air quality monitoring system becomes necessary. Oizom’s accurate and affordable monitors simultaneously provide data for gases, dust, odours and meteorological parameters. Additionally, the data visualisation and analytics software enable authorities to take corrective actions in time.Oizom’s air quality monitoring solution is helping environment professionals from the sectors like urban infrastructure, odourful sites, industries, and air quality research. Professionals from over 50 countries actively use Oizom technology to measure air quality accurately.What Makes Oizom Unique?Accurate DataOizom’s Air Quality monitoring devices function on the Patented E-breathing technology, which helps achieve the highest accuracy in air quality data.Tech SupportOizom provides remote technical support as well as physical support. We also have a ticketing system to maintain all support-related issues.Supports Third Party DevicesEnvizom can integrate third-party devices using APIs. So, users can access and analyze environmental data from multiple devices make on a single platform.Urban InfrastructureWith the rapid expansion of urban projects worldwide, one can see an exponential rise in pollution levels. Activities like construction, vehicular movement, and industrial activities contribute to this pollution rise. In such conditions, the lack of real-time air quality data compromises the ability of stakeholders to take corrective action.Hyper-local deployment of robust and accurate air quality monitors ensures city administrators’ empowerment. Air Quality monitoring is curial for improving the health of the citizens (residents, tourists, – schools, cities, airports, all applications from the Sheet1).Explore SectorUrban InfrastructureOdour MonitoringOdour MonitoringLandfills, wastewater treatment plants, Fertilizer facilities, paper-pulp industries, and other such industries often receive complaints about odour and other harmful gaseous emissions. In many such cases, enterprises face difficulties in resolving these complaints due to the lack of data on odour detection. Real-time odour monitoring enables the authorities to map odour sources and derive actionable data insights that help mitigate it.Additionally, the Data-driven Automation capabilities of the monitor can also trigger the activation of odour neutralisers. The solution plays a vital role in safeguarding the health and safety of the workers and disposing of false complaints.Explore SectorIndustriesVarious industrial processes give rise to harmful gases and other air pollutants. Frequent logistics, crucial for supply chain management in many industries, contribute to high particulate matter and other toxic gaseous substances. Air quality monitoring is essential in mitigating fugitive emissions and ensuring workers’ safety.Industries like mining and construction can benefit most. Providing timely reports of the emission levels from the industry/organisation also contributes to building the brand image. Ensuring good air quality further improves ESG scores and opens doors to investment opportunities. In addition, it also strengthens the Industrial 4.0 developments.Explore SectorIndustriesAir Quality ResearchAir Quality ResearchThe rise in affordable air quality monitoring has benefitted the various student research projects, governmental initiatives, and other privately owned research hubs. It has opened multiple avenues for research, including city-level sourcing and source apportionment for a better understanding of air quality.Provisions like Hyperlocal data monitoring and mobile air quality monitoring have become a possibility that has enhanced research capabilities. Further, user-friendly Data-analysing and Visualisation software with advanced analytics saves time and labour for researchers to work on their projects efficiently.Explore SectorExplore The Range of Environmental Monitoring ApplicationsAir Quality Monitoring in Smart CitiesSeaport Air Quality and Weather MonitoringResearch and ValidationLivestock & Agriculture Weather and Air MonitoringAir Quality Monitoring at HospitalHospitality & Tourism Air MonitoringPublic space Air MonitoringFlora and Fauna Air MonitoringAir quality monitoring for Railways and MetroAir Quality Monitoring for Smart CampusOdour monitoring for Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTP)Air Quality Monitoring in Schools And UniversitiesAir Quality Monitoring for AirportsAir quality monitoring for Roadside and HighwaysAir quality monitoring for Industrial FencelineAir Quality Monitoring for Environment, Health and Safety (EHS)Air quality monitoring for mines and quarriesTunnels and Multi-level Parking Air MonitoringBMC Mandate Air Quality Monitoring for Construction SitesConstruction Dust MonitoringYour Industry Not Listed Here?Schedule a call with our experts to attain a solution for your unique air quality monitoring requirementsRequest a CallCase StudiesReal-Time Odour Monitoring at Malad Waste Water Treatment Facility Using Oizom PolludroneReal-Time Weather Monitoring for Climate-Resilient Agriculture in the PhilippinesReal‑Time Odour & Air Quality Monitoring at Ajinomoto Food Processing Plant, JapanL&T Construction Installed AQBot PM Air Quality Monitors for the Mumbai Mega Tunnel ProjectJ.
